# UnLike

__A little and annoying batch program...__

### A short description
UnLike is a very small malware that you can bind with any program to make a very bad joke to your victim. As it is a new malware, it will not be detected by any antivirus. 

### How about the version ?

I'm currently developping an "As Is" version but soon, I'll put a version with more options to let you do  a customised malware.

### Which functions can I find in UnLike ?

- [x] An attack by OOM (Out Of Memory) 

- [x] A file spammer for the desktop

- [x] A typical "Folder Blasting" function

- [x] A very little AV disabler

- [x] An AV remover (for the most known AV's only"

- [x] A firewall disabler

- [x] A GUI killer

- [x] Now disable the internet connection
